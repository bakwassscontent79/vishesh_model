## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd "ML TRAINER FINAL BOSS"

# (Optional) Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows

# Install all required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ Running the App
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Then open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

✅ Valid CSV Format
Ensure your CSV contains a target column (for classification) and standard features like:

csv
Copy
Edit
age,sex,cp,trestbps,chol,fbs,restecg,thalach,exang,oldpeak,slope,ca,thal,target
📌 Important Notes
The app supports binary classification (target values should be 0 or 1).

Column names must be valid and consistent for correct preprocessing.

The app auto-handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales numerical ones.
