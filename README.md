## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
cd Heart_disease

# (Optional) Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ Running the App
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Navigate to http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

✅ Valid CSV Format
Make sure your CSV has a target column and relevant features like:

csv
Copy
Edit
age,sex,cp,trestbps,chol,fbs,restecg,thalach,exang,oldpeak,slope,ca,thal,target
📌 Important Notes
The uploaded CSV must include the target column (for classification).

The app currently supports binary classification (target should be 0 or 1).

For best results, ensure your column names match the expected format.

🧠 Model Evaluation
Evaluation metrics are generated using scikit-learn and visualized with Plotly.

Metrics include:

✅ Accuracy

🎯 Precision

🔁 Recall

🧮 F1 Score

📊 ROC Curve and AUC

🟦 Confusion Matrix

Made with ❤️ using Streamlit for instant insights and clean UI.

# Install all required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ Running the App
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Then open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

✅ Valid CSV Format
Ensure your CSV contains a target column (for classification) and standard features like:

csv
Copy
Edit
age,sex,cp,trestbps,chol,fbs,restecg,thalach,exang,oldpeak,slope,ca,thal,target
📌 Important Notes
The app supports binary classification (target values should be 0 or 1).

Column names must be valid and consistent for correct preprocessing.

The app auto-handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales numerical ones.

📊 Model Evaluation Metrics
✅ Accuracy

🔁 Recall

🎯 Precision

🧮 F1 Score

📈 ROC Curve (Plotly)

🟥 Confusion Matrix

Built using Streamlit and Scikit-learn for fast experimentation, model evaluation, and clean visualization.
